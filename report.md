## (1) (Un)Informed Search - Discuss heuristics

**Describe your heuristic for question 6:**

- [short description here]

- **Admissibility:** [Discuss its admissibility]
- **Consistency:** [Discuss its consistency ]



**Describe your heuristic for question 7:**

- I take the maximum distance between 2 coins added with the minimum distance from pacman to one of these coins. 

- **Admissibility:** It is admissible since Pacman would always at least need to travel this distance to reach the coins.
- **Consistency:** Considering 3 coins, the heuristic value would not
